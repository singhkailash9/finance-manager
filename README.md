# Finance Manager

## Description
Finance Manager is a web application designed to help users manage their personal or organizational finances. It provides tools for tracking transactions, visualizing financial data, and managing user profiles. This project is currently under development, and new features are being added regularly.

## Project Status
This project is in its `early stages of development`. Current features include user login page, transaction data management page, and basic data visualization page. All the pages are routed via React Router DOM. 

I am actively working on integrating application, adding more functionality and making the API for the application.
